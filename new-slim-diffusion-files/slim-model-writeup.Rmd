## Generation `10() late` drive drop

* At position 0.5 (the midpoint), add `DRIVE_DROP_SIZE` number of drive homozygotes.
* Write output out to console
* Let everyone (drives *and* wild-types) disperse according to the Gaussian dispersal kernel with mean 0 and standard deviation `sigma`
  + This means that the diffusion constant, `D`, equals `(1/2)(sigma^2)`
* Evaluate the interactions

## `reproduction()

* Sample 1 male neighbor from within the female's `MATING_INTERACTION_RADIUS` (interaction2)
* Calculate the `adult_density_force`, aka the number of individuals within the female's `LOCAL_INTERACTION_RADIUS`
  + Let the `expected_local_density` be based on the current population size, ie `(2*LOCAL_INTERACTION_RADIUS)*p1.individualCount`
* Calculate the `competition_ratio = adult_density_force/expected_local_density`
* Calculate the `exp_num_offspring`, based on the `BASELINE_NUM_OFFSPRING` (set to 3 by default) and whether the female is in a low density area:
  + `exp_num_offspring = BASELINE_NUM_OFFSPRING + (MAX_ADDITIONAL_NUM_OFFSPRING*exp(-EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_FACTOR*competition_ratio))`
* Draw the female's actual `num_offspring` from the Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the `exp_num_offspring`

### `modifyChild()`

* Tag each child with their genotype-fitness value
* Set the child at the mother's position

## `early()` -- after all embryos have been created

* Kill off all adults; set their `fitnessScaling` values to 0.0
* For the surviving juveniles, let their viability probabilities equal their fitness value times a global density control factor:
  + `	juveniles.fitnessScaling = (juveniles.tagF/drive_homozygote_fitness)*(GLOBAL_CAPACITY / length(juveniles))`

## `late()`

* Output the generation, population size, genotype counts, number of drive alleles, and rate of the drive
* Let everyone disperse according to the Gaussian kernel with standard deviation of `sigma`
* Evaluate the interactions
* End the simulation after a certain number of generations (default 100 generations after the drop -- stop at generation 110).
