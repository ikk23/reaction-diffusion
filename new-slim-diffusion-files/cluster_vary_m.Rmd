## Goal

* Vary the drop size (m)
  + Do 20 replicates of each
  + Calculate the P(increase) over all replicates
* Determine the "critical m" at which P(increase) = 90%
  + Go back to this m*, running like 100 replicates
  + Average over the 100 m* replicates; then plot the average number of drive alleles over time.
    * Does this increase monotonically?

## Python script

* Run SLiM for 100 generations
* Just control `DRIVE_DROP_SIZE`
*
