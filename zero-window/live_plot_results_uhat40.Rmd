```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Parameters

* uhat = 40%
* sigma = 0.01
* k = 0.2
* m = 0.001
* N = 30,000
* window = [0.499, 0.501]
* a_predicted = 0.025

## a vs P(increase) from before
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../cluster/u_hat=0.4_run/figures/april12_zoomed_in_a_vs_p_increase_uhat40.png")
```

## Live plots

### a = 0.06 (within the transition boundary; P(increase) around 20%)
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../zero-window/uhat40_a0.06.png")
```

### a = 0.0682 (the a that caused P(increase)=50%)

Drive spreads
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../zero-window/uhat40_a0.0682.png")
```

The number of drive heterozygotes initially increases, but in generation 25, the number of drive heterozygotes starts to decline and the number of drive homozygotes starts to increase.

### a = 0.05 (P(increase) still 0 but high above the a_predicted)
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../zero-window/uhat40_a0.05.png")
```
