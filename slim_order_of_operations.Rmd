## Order of operations:
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./slim/order-slim.png")
```

### 1a. reproduction

* Get all males within sigma = m = 0.01 of the female
* Randomly sample a male neighbor to mate with, with their mating weight = their fitness
* Number of offspring depends on the females fitness * a density-dependent factor (beta = 2, exponent = 2)
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./slim/num-offspring-code.png")
```


### 1b. modifyChild

* If the generation == the drive release generation (10), then check whether the mother was within the drive release square. If so, convert the child to d/d.
* Assign each child a tagF value based on their genotype. This will be used in the next generation's mating weights (for males) and fecundity (for females).
* Draw a displacement distance from the Exponential distribution with mean of sigma. Flip a coin to determine whether this is right or left of the parent1's position.
  + Use periodic conditions such that the boundaries wrap around -- no position is rejected.

### 2. early() events and fitness evaluation

* Kill off adults, ie enforce non-overlapping generations

### 3. late() events

* Only the new children are still present
* Color all individuals based on whether they have drive (drive = red, wt = blue)
* If gen < drive release generation, print out just the generation and the population size
* If gen >= drive release generation ("GEN::"), print out the generation, population size, frequency of the drive allele, genotype frequency of d/d homozygotes, and genotype frequency of d/wt heterozygotes
  + if the drive allele has already been lost, end the simulation
* Evaluate the i1 interaction (which calculates distances used for local mating / density regulation)
* If gen==100, end the simulation
