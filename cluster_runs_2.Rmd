## Python driver changes

* Added functions to calculate delta (according to the Mathematica equation) in the cluster csv output file.
* Now the csv will have 6 columns: `a,sigma,k,u_hat,delta,outcome`


## Before submitting to the cluster...

* Know your sigma, k, and uhat.
* Create a grid of *a* values. 
* Evaluate *delta* over the grid using `factored_delta(a,b,sigma,k,uhat)` with b=1
* Find the x-intercept (besides a = 0). This is where the critical propagule is predicted to occur. Evaluate *a* around this range.
